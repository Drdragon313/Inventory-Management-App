This is a Inventory management application created using React + Vite and I have used tailwind CSS for styling.
This application doesnot have a login page as it was not specified in the requirements.

Clone the repository on your local computer.
Open a terminal in the root folder of the application and type "npm i".
After all dependencies have been successfully installed type "npm run dev" in the terminal for the application to run on localhost.  
Application Flow:
The user will be routed to the dashboard by default as the appliaction starts.
There are a total of three pages "Dashboard", "Inventory Management" and "Product Registration".
